My First ROS Project. 
In this Project the main aim is to make a base car which is the base for the building up and adding on senesors to make to autonumus.


### Phase 1: Manual Motor Control

   Objective : Establish basic motor functionality by manually sending PWM signals from the terminal through a ROS 2 node to an Arduino UNO, which drives the motors via the L298N H-bridge motor driver.

   Hardware Used :
   > Raspberry Pi 5 (ROS 2 installed) ,
   > Arduino UNO ,
   > L298N H-Bridge motor driver ,
   > 4x low-powered DC geared motors (2 per side) ,
   > 2x 3.8V li-ion cells + PowerBank for Pi ,
   > USB cable for Arduino-RPi connection ,

   System Flow :
        [User input Termianl thru SSH] ----> [ROS2 manual_controll.py node] ----> [Arduino PWM Decoder] ----> [L298N Motor Driver] ----> [Motors]

   Phase 1 Outcomes :
  > Verified hardware wiring and motor connections ,
  > Validated serial communication between ROS 2 and Arduino ,
  > Successfully drove motors with variable PWM signals ,
  > Confirmed baseline rover movement before adding autonomous logic
